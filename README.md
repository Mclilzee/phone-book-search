Phonebook format is Number followed by the contact name, space separated, the name can contain as many spaces as required.
A Large phonebook both sorted and unsorted are provided. To test for sorting and for searching an already sorted phonebook. The list to be found of 500 name entries are provided in `find.txt` file.

Disclaimer: This is not meant to test overall of algorithms, if an algorithm performs better in this test, it doesn't mean that algorithm will always perform better. It only mean in this particular test in searching the phone book, it is the better algorithm to use. Changing phone book data might change the result.
